# IGP Pattern Printer

Takes a hex image created with the [Irregular Grid Painter](https://www.zlosk.com/pgmg/igp/index.html) and presents you "pixel"s at a time. Press a button to see the next few pixels. Saves your progress as you work.

Created to aid in creating pixel-art chainmail.

## Usage

Run and pass in a filepath to the exported hex image.

```rust
cargo run -- <FILENAME>
```

## Future work

A web version is in progress
